# MocSense
A portable and optionally battery-powered temperature/humidity sensor.
The finished report for this project is in the file titled "MocSense.pdf".

## 1. Project Description
We are building the all in one solution to personal environmental
management, a device which measures both temperature and humidity and
shows it on an inbuilt OLED display.

## 2. Specifications
The range of temperature that we aim for is simply anything that can’t freeze
and/or melt the project itself. As long as the temperature/humidity does not
reach extreme levels, the product should work just fine. Our accuracy is very
good, one should expect a 2-3 degrees (F) margin of error on temperature
and a ± 2 percent margin of error on the humidity.
